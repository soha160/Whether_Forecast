Weather Forecast Project 🌦️
Analyzed seasonal and monthly temperature trends using Pandas, Plotly, and machine learning (KMeans & DecisionTreeRegressor). Used melt() to reshape data and predicted 2018 temperatures. Visualized results with interactive charts in Jupyter Notebook.

What It Does

* Analyzes monthly & seasonal temperature trends

* Visualizes temperature variation (box, histogram, scatter, line, etc.)

* Clusters temperatures using KMeans

* Uses melt() to restructure data for seasonal analysis

* Predicts next year's temperature (2018) using Decision Tree Regressor


🧰 Tools Used
